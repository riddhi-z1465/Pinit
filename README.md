> _“What if I could build Pinterest... from scratch?”_  
> That single thought turned into late nights, 99+ console logs, and a whole lot of CSS grid magic. 😅

## 📚 What I Learned While Building Pinit

🔍 That CSS grid is both beautiful and brutal  
📱 Responsive design takes more brainpower than expected  
🧠 Real learning happens when things break (and they did 😅)  
🎨 UI/UX is more about feeling than features  
⚒️ There’s magic in building something real from just an idea
